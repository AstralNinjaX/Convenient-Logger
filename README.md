Logger
==========

This Logger class is designed to make logging easier. It has methods for starting and stopping a timer, logging the results, as well as methods for logging messages or errors.

It can log to any PrintStream provided, with a default of System.out for general output and System.err for errors. It can also tabify logging timers, showing their hierarchy.
